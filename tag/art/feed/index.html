										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The art of computer science.</span></strong></p>
<p>This is the start of a project that I have been wanted to do for a long time.</p>
<p>This is a digital Dance piece based Computer Science theory. During practice session data will be taken from the way the dancers move. This data will be used for the display projected behind the dances.<br />
<a href="http://www.readysaltedcode.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/20130506-090641.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full" alt="20130506-090641.jpg" src="http://www.readysaltedcode.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/20130506-090641.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>The project will use technology found in the home. This is to show the audience what their home devices can do and that computer science is not the just domain of experts. I want to show what is possible with kit found at home. During the whole project I will be releasing data (via GitHub) so that any one can create their own digital dance.</p>
<p>I am really excited as this merges my two passions dance and technology. I attended dancing school when I was younger until I had my first spinal fusion. That kind of put a dampener on any dance ambitions.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.readysaltedcode.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/20130506-090605.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full" alt="20130506-090605.jpg" src="http://www.readysaltedcode.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/20130506-090605.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>The timescale for the live performance is spring 2014. I will be live broadcasting the performance. During the run up to the live performance there will be 1-2 data hack events (near xmas)for people to attend and messy around with the data that we have gathered so far.</p>
<p>All comments and advice most welcome.</p>
