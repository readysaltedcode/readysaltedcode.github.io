										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">CAScade: Online CPD from CAS Computing at School.</span></strong></p>
<p><em>Today&#8217;s hangout: </em></p>
<p>The draft PoS Computing: <a href="http://computingatschool.org.uk/data/uploads/computing-04-02-13_001.pdf">Computing </a></p>
<p><strong>What is an algorithm</strong>: A formula or set of steps for solving a particular problem. To be an algorithm, a set of rules must be unambiguous and have a clear halting point. (www.webopedia.com) <em>this is one answer, there are many others</em>. More definitions listed below in the chat room comments section.</p>
<p>Key points discussed:<br />
What will each primary school delivered and how that will impact Secondary.</p>
<p>Dept of Education wanting to step away from levels.</p>
<p>Schools will be responsible for creating their own curriculum. Share resources, crowd source curriculums.</p>
<p>Agiles testing: testing quadrants. Using this for assessment tool. <a href="http://properosolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/agile-testing-quadrants.jpg">Agile Testing Quandrants</a></p>
<p>ALL subject levels are going- not just for ICT aka Computing.</p>
<p><strong>E- portfolios: as assessment.<br />
Competitions.<br />
End of year TechJams/ hackdays against certain criteria</strong>.</p>
<p>A good scratch activity that covers: logic, variables, objects, algorithm: <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/jlf04/195149">Scratch Quiz</a></p>

Here&#8217;s what we put in the guidance notes</p>

how to distinguish a ks2 algorithm from a ks4 algorithm<br />
having a clear conceptual hierarchy would help ext/diff, assessment etc.</p>
<p>Miles Berry<br />
11:40 AM<br />
An algorithm is a precise method of solving a problem. Algorithms range from the simple (such as instructions for changing a wheel on a car) to the ingenious (such as route-finding), and cover many different application areas (for example, cookery, drawing three- dimensional graphics; solving systems of constraints, such as a school timetable; understanding images; numerical simulation, and so on).</p>
<p>An algorithm can be expressed as a program in many different programming languages.<br />
There may be more than one algorithm to solve a single problem, differing in their simplicity, efficiency, or generality. For example, to find a path through a maze, one (simple, slow) algorithm might be to simply walk around at random until you find the exit. Another (more complicated) one would involve remembering where had been to avoid going down the same blind alley twice. Another might be to keep you left hand on the wall and walk till you find the exit (faster, but does not work on all mazes, and so less general).</p>

A formula or set of steps for solving a particular problem. To be an algorithm, a set of rules must be unambiguous and have a clear &#8216;stopping point&#8217;.<br />

<p>Miles Berry<br />
11:42 AM<br />
Hmm&#8230; clear stopping point&#8230; Hmm halting problemâ€¦</p>
<p>Ben Smith<br />
11:47 AM<br />
you can do boolean algebra on mine craft</p>
