										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lessons for Innovators was a lunchtime talk at NESTA.</p>
<p>If you have never been, as I hadn&#8217;t, I was impressed by their &#8216;cool&#8217; offices. Obviously not of a par with Google Cool but definitely cool. The space was well designed and accented with vibrant colours. It would make a very creative learning space. AKA my classroom&#8230;. One can dream.</p>
<p>Anyway back to the talk: which did have a little irony in the fact they were talking about MOOCs and online learning/ teaching innovation for it to be delivered in a traditional seminar /lecture format. Not that there is anything wrong with that and it was the best possible delivery method given all factors. They could have broadcast/ live streamed the lecture? Maybe next time.</p>
<p>There were 2 speakers, both of whom were excellent at the lectern.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/about/main/vice-chancellor">Martin Bean</a>,</strong> Vice Chancellor of the open university and <strong><a href="http://www.futurelearn.com/">Simon Nelson</a></strong> CEO at future learn.</p>
<p>Martin was first to speak, if you haven&#8217;t had the pleasure of hearing him you must take the opportunity. He is a brilliant and witty speaker. He spoke of hover boards and 21st Century, in the media portrays that we (education in all forms)</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;we are not being disruptive enough&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>A very interesting thought considering the exam and content reforms that are happening. the news this morning was of Gove&#8217;s announcement to change A levels to terminal exams? memory test? Lets leave that for another post;)</p>
<p>Back to Martin: in his 25 very successful years in arena of education in some form or another he has developed 8 rules.</p>
<ol>
<ol>1.Be Bold: challenge and don&#8217;t take no for answer. Look to the future and arrive their before anyone else does!</ol>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<ol>2.Get out of the blocks: Get your idea out even if it is not perfect. Iterate/ Sprint over and over again. Adapt , change and modify to improve your idea.</ol>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<ol>3.Collective Conscientiousness: get you team on board. Everyone needs to feel that they have a stake in the market. This is</ol>
</ol>
<p><em>Game Changing</em></p>
<ol>
<ol>.</ol>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<ol>4.Bring your Governance with you: involve them early. Challenge their &#8220;No not possible&#8221; responses. Sell your idea, what are you doing and why. Excite, enthuse everyone.</ol>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>5.Deadlines: no excuses, stick to them NO matter what. Fear is a blocker, communicate but stick to your deadlines. It gives focus to all stakeholders.</ol>
