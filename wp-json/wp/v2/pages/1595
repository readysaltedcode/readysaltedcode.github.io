But unfortunatelyYou can&#8217;t just download the Arduino platform and use it with the Flora. Because the Flora has a different microchip on the board plus a few other differences. The arduino standard release doesn&#8217;t know that the flora has a specific chip s you have to modify the software so that it can communicate properly with the board. Thankfully the ace\u00a0Adafruit team have developed a Florafied version of Arduino called <a href=\"https:\/\/learn.adafruit.com\/getting-started-with-flora\/download-software\" target=\"_blank\">Adafruit Learning System.<\/a><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>This version also works with the standard arduino boards.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There are two ways to Florafication:\u00a0<\/span>If you don\u2019t have Arduino already installed then download there software.<a title=\"Adafruit Learning System\" href=\"\/info\/adafruit-learning-system\/\" target=\"_blank\"> See here for full instructions<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/learn.adafruit.com\/getting-started-with-flora\/download-software\"><span class=\"s3\">https:\/\/learn.adafruit.com\/getting-started-with-flora\/download-software<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Flora-fi your version of Arduino by modifying the program files.

The extra length is for threading through the holes to make connections. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s4\">Cut an additional 4<\/span><span class=\"s2\"> pieces of wire to about 4.5&#8243; lengths. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">Strip the end of each wire enough to be able to thread through the holes and twist tie. Ensure that the wires don&#8217;t touch any of the other \u2018pads\u2019.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>This is will cause errors with the glove.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span style=\"color: #000080;\"><span class=\"s1\">STEP 4<\/span><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0\u00a0<\/span>Let\u2019s get sewing <\/span><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s2\"> Although it is not necessary to wear the glove whilst sewing to does help in getting a better fit.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>This is definitely a team activity.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 \u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s2\">Let\u2019s Get Stitching.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/flic.kr\/p\/pc6Qts\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7516\/15221825744_7233a3f8ef_z.jpg\" alt=\"Colour sensor for piano glove\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s2\" style=\"color: #000080;\">THE FLORA: <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s2\">Attach the Flora to the glove on the centre of your hand, top side. Use any unused pads (holes) and stitch in place with normal thread. This will hold the Flora in place. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s2\" style=\"color: #000080;\">Finger Stitching NEOPIXEL<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s2\">Wrap the NeoPixel wiring around your index finger. End with the Neopixel on the TOP of your fingernail.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Secure the wires in place with a running (whip) stitch.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Thread wires to the neopixel ensuring a good connection.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Once secure stitch neopixel to the glove.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s2\" style=\"color: #000080;\">Finger Stitching Color sensor <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s2\">Similar to the neopixel stitching arp the are of the colour sensor around the same finger until the sensor is touching the base of the index finger (where your fingerprint is located). Remember not to pull the wire too tight as this may damage pr break the connections. Stitch the wire into place and then the sensor. Check for correct fit. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s2\" style=\"color: #000080;\">Stitching Codec proto board<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p8\"><span class=\"s2\">Keep the glove on place the Codec Board above the wrist joint.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>This will allow you to bend you wrist so that your hand can move freely and comfortably.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Depending of the length of the glove you will be stitching the board about half way along its length. The Perma-Proto board from Adafruit is designed to mirror the connections of a half sized breadboard.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Connecting the battery<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Make sure that the Flora power switch is off. Connect the battery to the Flora\u2019s JST connector. This is the white plastic cube opposite the usb connection. The battery can be secure between the Flora and the Glove. The wire loop can be left. Be careful\u00a0to connect\u00a0and disconnect the battery without pulling by the power and ground wires themselves.\u00a0For a more permanent attachment the wire can be stitched to the glove.<\/p>\n<h1>Play your own piece of art!<\/h1>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Playing music with your hand.
