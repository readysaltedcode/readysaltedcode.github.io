The second app allows others to control the car via instructions (events) trigger in the remote sent via the web to the master controller app near\u00a0the car.\u00a0 You can remote control from anywhere in the world. All you need is internet access.\u00a0 Having remote controlled a car based in South Africa from the UK we already know how awesome it feels.\u00a0 This project gives you a little insight into The Internet of Things (IoT), how things like satellites communicate with ground (earth) based control centres or any other remote controlled device.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Design your App<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Remember when designing your app you have a maximum of 5 tabs. The control of the remote vehicle is based on the movement of the phone itself or trigger by button presses within each tab of the app. What order do you think they should be in?<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Required Tabs<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><strong>INFO<\/strong>: Explains what your app does and how to use it<br \/>\n<strong>STEERING<\/strong>: To activate the steering API call<br \/>\n<strong>GEAR<\/strong>: TO activate the gear\/ speed API call that detects the angle and speed of motion of the phone.<br \/>\n<strong>DATA<\/strong>: Displays the data the phone is generating and transmitting via the API calls and event handling.<br \/>\n<strong>DEMO<\/strong>: this tab has a demo mode plus individual commands to control the car<\/p>\n<p>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=j03U0k-8HFU<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color: #000080;\">STEP 1 <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Login<\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Login into<a href=\"http:\/\/artofcs-123.appspot.com.storage.googleapis.com\/Screen-Shot-2015-11-07-at-09.52.46.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft  wp-image-247\" src=\"http:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/iHbkaP3VzQyS2zIFBLf6VLE864P5tZoOyjFGfmex8-CRYrRiu3TC4lUFdXPFlrslqQIbFiovqvlHXns2I6GucXg=s150-c\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-11-07 at 09.52.46\" width=\"185\" height=\"185\" \/><\/a> your account at <a href=\"http:\/\/appshed.com\"><span class=\"s2\">appshed.com<\/span><\/a>.
