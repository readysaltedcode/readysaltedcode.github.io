Online resources will be shared to enable others the ability to remix share the data visualisations using our motion\/Skeleton data to create different effects. We will be using biometric data in the development and performance of the ballet. This new ballet, [pain]Byte, is all about chronic pain and biomedical engineering. It looks at what it means to be in pain through dance and imagery using technology such as: data visualisations, bio metric data, wearables and projections. It links computing with medical and how data is transmitted across networks to how pain signals are transmitted through the pain pathway within the body. The live theatre and VR experience research will be focusing on how the audience&#8217;s exposure and understanding are impacted by the difference mediums used for painbyte.

The live performance will be supported by an art and video installation prior to the live performance. The installation exhibition will enable audience to interact and view close up the technology and wearables that will be used in the performance. \u00a0 We will be working with data from The Met Office using climate\u00a0information to influence the choreography\u00a0of the ballet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a title=\"DataStorm-moodboard\" href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/129087728@N06\/26716076384\/\" data-flickr-embed=\"true\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/c1.staticflickr.com\/8\/7292\/26716076384_c50699d4de.jpg\" alt=\"DataStorm-moodboard\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" \/><\/a><script src=\"\/\/embedr.flickr.com\/assets\/client-code.js\" async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<p><iframe class=\"iframe video\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/s1oWXsBDUvo?rel=0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h2>Phase I<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/arrastre.org\" target=\"_blank\">Arrastre<\/a>: is a digital data driven dance performance that derives its movements and concepts from computer science theory. A live performance, plus a series of workshops breaking down the computer science theory behind the performance, will constitute the whole programme. The programme will include data visualisation, images influenced and triggered by data from the dancers, wearable technology and choreography. The work will interpret computer science theories through dance, relating the programme to the new Computing curriculum for schools in England; devising a new methodology that could be applied as a cross-curricular approach for learning.
