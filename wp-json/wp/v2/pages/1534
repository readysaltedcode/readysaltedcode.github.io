There\u2019s a GEMMA board, four sewable bright RGB pixels, a battery holder and batteries, 2-ply conductive thread, alligator clips to help you test out your circuit, and a USB cable for programming GEMMA.\u201d Adafruit.com<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The Gemma does not have a Serial port connection for debugging so the serial port monitor will not be able to send\/receive data. Unlike the Flora, the Gemma must be connected to a computer via a USB cable.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>Set Up IDE (if not done already)<\/li>\n<li>Check your kits has everything<\/li>\n<li>If new to sewing, practice on some scrap material first.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>To upload your code (sketch)\n<ul>\n<li>Don&#8217;t press-and-hold the reset button(small black button near D0 pin), be sure to press-and-release!

Gemma was designed to drive short segments of NeoPixels. There is enough RAM on the attiny85 to drive 100 pixels, but depending on program RAM usage you may have to scale back to 60 or 40. \u00a0Then you have to\u00a0think about Power.<\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Lets Get Started<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Now it&#8217;s time to say &#8220;hello, world&#8221;\u00a0to your new Gemma with the basic Blink sketch.<\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Step 1: Upload Blinky sketch to your Gemma<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Launch arduino application<\/li>\n<li>Open blinky (<a title=\"Blinky.py\" href=\"\/info\/blinky-py\/\">copy and past from here<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>Click the tick icon to verify the code<\/li>\n<li>Press the button on the Gemma to enable the board to receive the code.<\/li>\n<li>Click the arrow icon to upload the code to the Gemma<\/li>\n<li>The RED led onboard the Gemma should blink.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>WHY do Blinky? \u00a0to test that your board is functioning properly and that you have successfully verified and upload a sketch onto your Gemma. \u00a0This step can be skipped if you have already worked with Gemma. Step one helps with understanding of debugging should any issues arise.<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Step 2: Stitch\u00a0a NEOPIXEL<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-139\" src=\"http:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/Poc8z7nLjgHOtTJOSWlPx_Y3BKrajmWR-lOElrWxXV0k54XTe4VTIh9_1XocZ9B0dDlKLmzl05nD4Z_y0h33sEY=s300\" alt=\"neopixel\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Depending on how many neopixels you have connect the first one to the Gemma using ground, D1 and Vout. \u00a0Ensure that the data line (from D1) it tied off to the first arrow on the neopixel. Test the circuit using <a title=\"Gemma Sample Code\" href=\"\/info\/gemma-sample-code\/\">headdress code <\/a>modifying the number &#8216;7&#8217; \u00a0to 1. \u00a0This tells the code that there is only 1 neopixel in the strip. \u00a0modify this number to the final number of neopixels in your project.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Continue Stitching<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Power and the Ground thread can be a continue piece of the thread. Ensure that the connection at each point is secure. \u00a0This can be achieved by stitching a few times around each connection hole. The &#8211;&gt; must be pointing <span style=\"color: #000080;\"><strong>away<\/strong><\/span> from the GEMMA<\/p>\n<p>The stitching between the ground\u00a0and the power\u00a0are a little faster as you don&#8217;t have to tie of the thread at each point as you do with the data thread. \u00a0To stitch 7 neopixels and the Gemma can take anywhere between 30 -45 minutes. \u00a0Longer if you are new to sewing.<\/p>\n<p>Check that all threads are clear of each other. Touching \/ crossing threads will cause electrical shorts and your project won&#8217;t work.<\/p>\n<p><a data-flickr-embed=\"true\" href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/129087728@N06\/15191084124\/\" title=\"Stitching for light up with Gemma Project by readysaltedcode, on Flickr\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7500\/15191084124_4dc767e0db_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" alt=\"Stitching for light up with Gemma Project\"><\/a><script async src=\"https:\/\/embedr.flickr.com\/assets\/client-code.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<p><a data-flickr-embed=\"true\" href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/129087728@N06\/15812575692\/\" title=\"Stitching Neopixels by readysaltedcode, on Flickr\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/live.staticflickr.com\/7491\/15812575692_6434bcc86c_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" alt=\"Stitching Neopixels\"><\/a><script async src=\"https:\/\/embedr.flickr.com\/assets\/client-code.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Step 3\u00a0Code and Go<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Upload the <a title=\"Gemma Sample Code\" href=\"\/info\/gemma-sample-code\/\">Headdress<\/a> code to your Gemma. <span style=\"color: #808080;\"><em>Remember the button press and release to be able to upload the code to the Gemma<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #000080;\">Possibilities<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>This project is similar to the LightUp PointeShoes but that uses a Flora because of the input required from the velostat pressure switch.
