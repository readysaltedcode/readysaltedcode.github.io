Welcome to my blog"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>I have been teaching IT since 2006 and a lot has changed in that time.<\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<div>I am self-professed geek and huge sci-fi fan. My teaching allows me to use sci-fi examples and technological innovations to engage and educate students. I am currently following the Apps for Good course using google app-inventor. This course has been mentioned alot in the press recently. also looking at Applicationcraft with help and evaluatin of some students to teach and develop apps. Students love this topic and the what they produce amazes me.

Delivered over 6 weeks. I teach 1 hour a week and I will also be teaching 2\/6 lessons with 3 yr9 students. The yr9s have developed some activities and work for the yr2 class. It should be great fun. More on that later.<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I have been teaching IT since 2006 and a lot has changed in that time. I am self-professed geek and huge sci-fi fan.
