How might we challenge the perception and experience of pain though play, shift the focus to sensation? Clare has\u00a0a chronic pain condition and as a result of this have developed heightened sensory responses to her\u00a0environs and to my internal physiological activity. Instead of trying to block pain as it arrives she has learned to go into it, explore it&#8217;s fluctuations, challenge any sense that it might be fixed. she uses sound, shape, texture to transform the experience of pain into sensation, it&#8217;s an internal sensory system, like a sort of self-taught synesthesia.<\/div>\n<div class=\"spacer\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"project-module module project-module-text text align-center\">\n<div class=\"main-text\">\n<div>\n<div>She presented a paper entitled: \u201cBrain in Pain: body mapping, pain visualisation and mapping the invisible\u2019 at a research workshop at \u2018Electronic Visualisation in the Arts\u2019 Conference in London in July 2014.(1) During the\u00a0presentation http:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/clareplumley\/brain-in-pain (2) she talked about the signalling system of a brain in pain, &#8216;brain and pain maps&#8217;, ideas of induced synesthesia and brain plasticity.
