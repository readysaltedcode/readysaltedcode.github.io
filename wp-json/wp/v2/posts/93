Oh the fun we both had. I remember the first course I did last year, AI Advance route&#8230;.. why oh why did I do that. I remember the pressure of trying to complete assignments\/homework and to study the required 8-10hrs.<\/p>\n<p>This and others are not designed for Teachers. We (teachers) are already overloaded and have very little time to carry out personal study. You may disagree, which is fine, but no bashing teachers as that is already done very well at present.<\/p>\n<p>I am not disregarding those online courses, they are amazing and I have learnt so much from them. It is just the format does lend itself well to those of us who are teachers. The MOOC (mass online open classroom) has, in general, a very small completion rate of anywhere between 3-7%. This is not to say those courses aren&#8217;t successful but for teachers we need a different approach. This is something that I have been hoping to develop further and it looks like I will be able to do just that after the new year.<\/p>\n<p>Wish me luck on this new adventure.<\/p>\n<p>What and how would you like to learn online?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I was speaking to my lovely colleague, Russ, today about taking the Stanford\/Coursera online courses.
