We were able to create two distinct pieces for [pain]Byte: The ballet and the accompanying VR experience that looked at VR as storytelling in the world of chronic pain.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">[pain]Byte is the 3rd ballet and we used this opportunity to bring to light the issues and challenges of an invisible disability to audiences. The R&amp;D of the biometric data and the VR experience in order to present data that was informed by and in response to the human body. We are not for profit organisation, providing innovative digital computer science STEAM focused education &amp; curriculum opportunities including workshops, training and produce data driven dance performance to highlight, engage and encourage people into loving computer science education.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/241495760\" width=\"640\" height=\"323\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/241495760\">painbyte VR<\/a> from <a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/user73835131\">Genevieve Smith-Nunes<\/a> on <a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\">Vimeo<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What an amazing Sunday evening. pain]byte &#8211; Chronic pain and the invisible world of pain.
