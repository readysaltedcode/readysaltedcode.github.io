The event is split into morning and afternoon sessions to make it easier for schools to release teachers and students. During the sessions teacher will be able to see what their students are learning as well as take time to discuss with other teacher what approaches they are going to take with the Pi and the new computing curriculum. \u00a0(If we get enough teachers I may swap one of the sessions for a teacher only session(am likely).<\/p>\n<p>Eventbrite Details:<a title=\"Booking Page\" href=\"http:\/\/goo.gl\/lkBBp2\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/goo.gl\/lkBBp2<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>9 &#8211; 3.30pm 12th December 2013: The Auditorium, Clearleft, \u00a0Brighton (no parking)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.readysaltedcode.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/hour_of_code.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-611\" alt=\"hour_of_code\" src=\"http:\/\/www.readysaltedcode.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/hour_of_code.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.7;\">Take the BBC quiz to see what you know about computer programs<\/span><a style=\"line-height: 1.7;\" title=\"Quiz on Computer Programs\" href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/magazine-15952227\" target=\"_blank\">\u00a0http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/magazine-15952227<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Just finalising the planning for a whole day event during CS week in december. \u00a0Getting very excited about the Python Pi day. \u00a0We are hoping to run 2 workshops during the day. \u00a0One in the morning and one in the&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.readysaltedcode.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/604"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.readysaltedcode.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.readysaltedcode.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.readysaltedcode.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.readysaltedcode.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=604"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/www.readysaltedcode.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/604\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.readysaltedcode.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=604"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.readysaltedcode.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=604"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.readysaltedcode.org\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=604"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
