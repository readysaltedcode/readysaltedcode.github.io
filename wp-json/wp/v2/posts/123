My teaching allows me to use sci-fi examples and technological innovations to engage and educate students.<\/p>\n<p>On <strong>January<\/strong> 11th I was quoted in the Guardian (front page article) in reference to Michael Gove&#8217;s announcement regarding the ICT programme of study:<\/p>\n<p>Genevieve Smith Nunes, an IT and business studies teacher at Dorothy Stringer high school in Brighton, also welcomed the announcement. She said: &#8220;In my own school we have developed our own programme of study anyway, because of the constraints that ICT has \u2013 but still incorporating all of the elements that are there [in the existing curriculum].<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If they scrapped ICT, then a lot of teachers might feel that their jobs are at risk \u2013 depending on how Gove presents that. That wouldn&#8217;t be a worry at my school because we&#8217;re quite forward- thinking about what students need.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;By taking away what is prescriptive, it would allow the teacher and student to develop the [computer science] curriculum together and make it effective, creative and thoughtful \u2026 If universities are going to help us develop the curriculum content that can only be a benefit from the classroom teacher&#8217;s perspective.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>I was also a panellist on the Guardian live blog talking about technology and it&#8217;s benefits as a learning and support tool. It was a great experience if not a little scary. I was blogging in the staff room in my free period trying to make sure that I didn&#8217;t have any spelling or grammar errors. Thanks go out to the staff for helping me :)<\/p>\n<p>With the recent announcement from Michael Gove in terms of scrapping the ict programme of study. No need to panic, it is in regards to what is taught in schools and not the removing ICT from the curriculum.<\/p>\n<p>from Michael Gove&#8217;s speech Children COULD be using Scratch\u2026 we have been using Scratch for a few years and I am currently piloting a project teaching Scratch to a class of Year2 students. He talks about 11 year olds using Scratch and year 2s are 6 and 7years old. Then about yr11 developing apps: I developed a SoW (13 and 14years old) scheme of work where students plan and build apps using various tools including Appshed, Applicationcraft and the Apps for Good course.<\/p>\n<p>At Sussex Downs College we have kept up with the times and modified our curriculm accordingly. We now develop skills in programming using multiple development environments and language. We have decided to use open source or freeware as this enables access from home without any financial impact on parents or guardians.<\/p>\n<p>Outside of College: I am working on a scratch programming project with 3 local primary schools. Delivered over 6 weeks. I taught 1 hour a week and I will also be teaching 2\/6 lessons with 3 yr9 students. Each school had a different focus: Animation, Gaming and Lego WeDo. It course was a resounding success. I am looking forward to delivering training to more teachers via the CAS Master Teacher Program and Teaching Schools. These sessions will be in South East at various venues.<\/p>\n<p>Events: Speaking<\/p>\n<ul>\n<ul>Google Guardian Junior HackEvent<\/ul>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<ul>TeachMeet Brighton<\/ul>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<ul>CAS Conference<\/ul>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<ul>Stringer Hackday<\/ul>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<ul>Brighton Digital Festival<\/ul>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<ul>Raspberry Jam London<\/ul>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<ul>Liberal Democrat Conference: fringe event<\/ul>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<ul>MozFest<\/ul>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<ul>Google TeachFirst Conference<\/ul>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<ul>#nanohack<\/ul>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<ul>#GameLab<\/ul>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>RaspberryJam Xmas London<\/ul>\n<p>What about 2013: Even MORE exciting than 2012.<br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.digimaka.com\">DigiMaka<\/a> is a social enterprise co-founded with Justin Kirby.
