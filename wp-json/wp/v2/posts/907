Genevieve said that one of the most interesting\u00a0things\u00a0about being in the theatre was how intimate it feels given the capacity of the theatre is 440 in total and 210 at the event. The intimacy of the theatre made it feel more familiar even with its great history.<\/p>\n<p>During the day there were speakers from Thomson Reuters, Accenture and Hertfordshire University talking about career histories to wearable tech. Genevieve was the closing keynote with a few live demos and a performance from [arra]stre Big Data. \u00a0The live demo of the data visualisation with the Kinect was fun,\u00a0especially\u00a0with\u00a0audience joining in. From making dataviz angels to one girl, a gymnast, even performing a backflip. AMAZING! \u00a0Though RISK ASSESSMENT was flashing before Genevieve\u2019s eyes\u2026 For all those teachers out there you will understand exactly what she was feeling.<\/p>\n<p>Genevieve\u2019s talk started with a little bit about her own history and exposure to computer science \/ technology. With references to the BBC Micro, Dragon 32 and Amiga Computers, she then went on to talk about her passion for Computer Science and her interest in Bio Medical Engineering.
