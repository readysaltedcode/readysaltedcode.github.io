A kind of create your own performance.<\/p>\n<p>What does it mean to have chronic pain, how does it feel?  The choreographer and producer both suffer from chronic pain and have different spinal implants.  Using their data and experience we want the audience to connect emotionally with the idea of living with pain without you, the audience, experiencing any pain.  How is pain transmitted in the body? How to does this relate to data signal transmitted across a network or within the brain.<\/p>\n<p>Using data visualisation of networks to aid the audiences experience and understanding.  We initially developed this idea in [data]Storm, using network simulations and ballet to visualise transmission and viruses.
