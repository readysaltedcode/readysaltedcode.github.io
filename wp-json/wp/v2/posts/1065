I have had an amazing time sharing resources, ideas and computing content with all of the educators on the Tour.  Each educational venue has had very different time allocation, teaching resources and budget but they have all had passion and verve to create the best opportunities for their students in their schools.<\/p>\n<p>There was always something surprising at each place for example in Wigan.  Wigan UTC has a vertical farm, pcb fabrication and an indoor climbing wall.

I am really looking forward to seeing their approaches to Computer Science as the Scottish courses are so creative.
