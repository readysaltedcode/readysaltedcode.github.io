This is our 3rd masterclass but our first at London MET University.  A big thank you to the fantastic student ambassadors at the University, they were brilliant.<\/p>\n<p>This is what the Royal Institution of Great Britain have to say about their programme.<br \/>\n\u201cRi Mathematics, Engineering and Computer Science Masterclasses are hands-on and interactive extracurricular sessions led by top experts from academia and industry for keen and talented young people all around the UK.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>We delivered a Masterclass on Computer Science, showing the students what the subject means to readysaltedcode and our STEAM approach to learning. We had an in-depth look at the code and  data visualisations used in [data]Storm. They all loved the Protocols and Virus dataviz and who wouldn\u2019t love the fantastic work by animateddata.<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/flic.kr\/p\/qC4grY\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/farm8.staticflickr.com\/7556\/16160593590_a5e9a222ba.jpg\" alt=\"Crumble Board\" width=\"182\" height=\"307\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nBefore we moved on the hands-on electronics using Crumble we had a discussion about VR (virtual reality)and AR (augmented reality)in the classroom.  The year 9 students came up with interesting uses for the tech in history, geography, science and maybe even drama.  Re living history in an immersive environment, visiting places you can\u2019t get to, seeing a heart pumping in 3D to virtual sets and environments for plays. This is just a few of the amazing ideas they came up with. <\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"680\" height=\"383\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/uNYhZ_ojXEE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>Then the fun with crumble.  We had great fun using Redfern Electronics&#8217; Crumble Board to light up single sparkles to LED strips and LED rings. If only we had more time. <\/p>\n<p>A super fun day<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>RI Masterclass at London MET University We love giving RI masterclasses at readysaltedcode.
