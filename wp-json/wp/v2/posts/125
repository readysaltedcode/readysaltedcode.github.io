Obviously not of a par with Google Cool but definitely cool. The space was well designed and accented with vibrant colours. It would make a very creative learning space. AKA my classroom&#8230;. One can dream.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway back to the talk: which did have a little irony in the fact they were talking about MOOCs and online learning\/ teaching innovation for it to be delivered in a traditional seminar \/lecture format. Not that there is anything wrong with that and it was the best possible delivery method given all factors. They could have broadcast\/ live streamed the lecture? Maybe next time.<\/p>\n<p>There were 2 speakers, both of whom were excellent at the lectern.<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.open.ac.uk\/about\/main\/vice-chancellor\">Martin Bean<\/a>,<\/strong> Vice Chancellor of the open university and <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.futurelearn.com\/\">Simon Nelson<\/a><\/strong> CEO at future learn.<\/p>\n<p>Martin was first to speak, if you haven&#8217;t had the pleasure of hearing him you must take the opportunity. He is a brilliant and witty speaker. He spoke of hover boards and 21st Century, in the media portrays that we (education in all forms)<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;we are not being disruptive enough&#8221;<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>A very interesting thought considering the exam and content reforms that are happening. the news this morning was of Gove&#8217;s announcement to change A levels to terminal exams? memory test? Lets leave that for another post;)<\/p>\n<p>Back to Martin: in his 25 very successful years in arena of education in some form or another he has developed 8 rules.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<ol>1.Be Bold: challenge and don&#8217;t take no for answer. Look to the future and arrive their before anyone else does!<\/ol>\n<\/ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol>\n<ol>2.Get out of the blocks: Get your idea out even if it is not perfect. Iterate\/ Sprint over and over again. Adapt , change and modify to improve your idea.<\/ol>\n<\/ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol>\n<ol>3.Collective Conscientiousness: get you team on board. Everyone needs to feel that they have a stake in the market. This is<\/ol>\n<\/ol>\n<p><em>Game Changing<\/em><\/p>\n<ol>\n<ol>.<\/ol>\n<\/ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol>\n<ol>4.Bring your Governance with you: involve them early. Challenge their &#8220;No not possible&#8221; responses. Sell your idea, what are you doing and why. Excite, enthuse everyone.<\/ol>\n<\/ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ol>5.Deadlines: no excuses, stick to them NO matter what. Fear is a blocker, communicate but stick to your deadlines. It gives focus to all stakeholders.<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Lessons for Innovators was a lunchtime talk at NESTA.
