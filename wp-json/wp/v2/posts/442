This is to show the audience what their home devices can do and that computer science is not the just domain of experts. I want to show what is possible with kit found at home. During the whole project I will be releasing data (via GitHub) so that any one can create their own digital dance.<\/p>\n<p>I am really excited as this merges my two passions dance and technology. I attended dancing school when I was younger until I had my first spinal fusion. That kind of put a dampener on any dance ambitions.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.readysaltedcode.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/20130506-090605.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full\" alt=\"20130506-090605.jpg\" src=\"http:\/\/www.readysaltedcode.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/05\/20130506-090605.jpg\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The timescale for the live performance is spring 2014.

During the run up to the live performance there will be 1-2 data hack events (near xmas)for people to attend and messy around with the data that we have gathered so far.<\/p>\n<p>All comments and advice most welcome.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The art of computer science.
