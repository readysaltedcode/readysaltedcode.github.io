It is because of the community, such as <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/openkinect.org\/wiki\/Main_Page\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">OpenKinect<\/span><\/a><\/span>, and the brilliant <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><a title=\"Greenfoot\" href=\"http:\/\/www.greenfoot.org\/door\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Greenfoot<\/span><\/a><\/span> IDE that enables you to code in java which using the kinect<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.greenfoot.org\/doc\/kinect\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"> OpenNI libraries.<\/span><\/a><\/span> Greenfoot has been designed to make it easier to learn OOP, specially java. I had to modify the MAC version as it is based on 10.7. \u00a0I will upload the details on how I made it work in a few weeks. Greenfoot is opensource so if you have a passion for another language feel free to make a Python version.<\/h6>\n<h6><\/h6>\n<p><iframe width=\"680\" height=\"383\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/R7rghpAo_sk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h6><\/h6>\n<h6>This a screen recording of using Greenfoot and the Kinect. It is a low res version of the recording.<\/h6>\n<h6>Raspberry Pi: Why Educational. \u00a0A lot of schools in the UK have a few <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.raspberrypi.org\/archives\/5464\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Pi<\/span><\/a><\/span> but not maybe a class set. I am going to be using them as dataloggers using an ultrasonic sensor, piface and few other bits of kits. \u00a0An adruino would be able to do realtime datalogging which I am using in the costumes. So before the barage of use something else hits, I am specifically choosing the Pi so that educators can use it is a different way other than as an alternative to a desktop.<\/h6>\n<h6>Wearables: 2 reasons: collecting data from the dancers and controlling LEDs on their costumes. \u00a0Apart from the fact that is incredibly exciting to develop using wearables. NOW the important question what to choose? ALL of them&#8230; would be lovely but there is a cost involved with some of the professional kit. \u00a0Also I want people to be able to do it at home or school for example without the need for really expensive kit or extremely complex coding. \u00a0Some of the costumes will require some complex code but we will providing the code and data during the project (after thorough testing).<\/h6>\n<h6><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.adafruit.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Adafruit<\/span><\/a><\/span> and <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/lilypadarduino.org\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Lilypad<\/span><\/a><\/span>: the two wearable champions: the devices that we are using are the Gemma, Flora, Lilypad Tiny, Lilypad mainboard. For example check out my jeans that I wore for #BETT2014. A very simple pregprogrammed board. \u00a0The twinkle\/ firefly kit comes with Power, board and LEDS (I changed the colour of the LEDs as I had them already). \u00a0My 2 sons 8 and 4 helped me with some of the sewing and where to place the lights. \u00a0It took a little longer but it was fun.
